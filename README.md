Technical assignment
Below are the test parameters :
- Create a custom module which defines two custom services and an
endpoint to demonstrate them.
- Service 1: The Adder - custom class that defines a method to take
two numbers as input parameters and return their sum.
- Service 2: The String Formatter - uses service 1 to add two numbers
and format them into a translatable string: “The product of 100 and
125 is 225”
- Controller endpoint uses service 2 to display the string produced by
service 2.
- You must place your work in a gitlab or github public project
repository so we can review your work.
- You may use whatever tools you wish but please make note of which
tools you are using and a short writeup of how you came to your
solution - this writeup should be placed in the README.md file of
your project repository.
- The sooner you are able to deliver the result, the higher you will be
rated.

You will be evaluated on code quality, speed and the overall architecture of
your solution.
